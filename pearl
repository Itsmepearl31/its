Case Study: "Inventory Management System for a Small Retail Store"
Background: You are tasked with developing a simplified inventory management system for a small retail store. The store sells a variety of products, and the owner needs a system to keep track of the inventory levels, update stock, and generate reports on the current inventory status.

Assignment Tasks:
1.	Understanding the Requirements:
o	The inventory management system should be able to store information about different products. Each product has the following attributes:
	Product ID (an integer)
	Product Name (a string)
	Quantity in Stock (an integer)
	Price per Unit (a float)
o	The system should allow the user to:
	Add a new product to the inventory.
	Update the stock quantity for an existing product.
	Display the details of a product when given the Product ID.
	Generate a report listing all products with their details.

2.	Design the System:
o	Use structures in C to define the data for a product.
o	Implement the required functionalities using functions. For example, you might create functions such as addProduct(), updateStock(), displayProduct(), and generateReport().
3.	Implementation:
o	Write the C program that implements the inventory management system based on the design.
o	Ensure the program handles errors, such as trying to update the stock for a product that does not exist.

4.	Case Study Questions:
o	Q1: Explain how you used structures to manage product data. Why is using a structure advantageous in this case?
o	Q2: Discuss how functions are used to organize the code. How do they improve the maintainability of the program?
o	Q3: What kind of testing did you perform to ensure your system works correctly? Provide examples of test cases and their expected outcomes.
o	Q4: Suppose the store expands and starts selling multiple categories of products (e.g., electronics, groceries). How would you modify your program to accommodate this change?
